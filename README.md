A simple mod that lets you click on the D20 icon in the Combat Encounters tab to roll 4df + Initiative Skill.

The Initiative Skill is determined by what is already a default setting. To change this go to: Game Settings > Configure Settings > Fate Core Official > Initiative Skill

For those brand new to FATE Core on FoundryVTT you might only have the options 'None' and 'Disable' in the drop down. To add the Initiative Skill to this drop down you need to go to: Fate Core Official > Setup Skills > Setup > Add New Skill and then add all skills or just your Initiative Skill. As of making this readme I am unaware if this is case sensitive or not.

Make sure you click Save Changes and press F5 or Refresh the page. Also make sure that the character sheets have the Iniative Skill somewhere in the skills section. Then you should be ready to go.

For more questions on skills go to: Compendium Packs > Fate Core Official Documentation > Fate Core Official - System Documentation This should answer more questions than just skills.
